<h4><i>Counters Task</i></h4>

<h5>Description:</h5>
<p>Implement a counter/timer functionality. One must be able to instantiate multiple counters, stop/start them simultaneously, but independantly via buttons or by specifying an initial value in the input field.
The implementation must be designed by using only context, i.e. simulated objects(without global variables) and the HTML elements must be generated dynamically rather than hardcoded in.</p>
